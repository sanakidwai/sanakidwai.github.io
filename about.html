        <p> I'm a <b>final-year linguistics PhD student</b> at the University of Cambridge (Fitzwilliam College). I work on minimalist syntax and morphology. My PhD project is on <b>the properties of Voice heads in Urdu.</b> My supervisors are <b>Theresa Biberauer</b> and <b>Ian Roberts</b> and my advisor is <b>Adam Ledgeway.</b> </p>
        
        <p> I am funded by the <a href = "https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk/sana-kidwai-2019-cohort" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank"> Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholarship</a>. </p>

        <p> <b>Phases in the Verbal Domain</b><br>
        Invited speaker for Newcastle University workshop on <i>Phases in the Verbal Domain</i>, 26-27 June 2023 (<a href = "https://www.lagb.org.uk/forum/13121004" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">call for papers</a>). Title TBD.

        <h3> research interests </h3>
        
        <p> My primary research areas are <b>case systems</b> and <b>Urdu syntax</b>. Other research interests include <b>decomposition of the verbal domain</b>, <b>word order</b>, and <b>South Asian linguistics.</b> </p>
        
        <!--
        <p> My <b>PhD project</b> aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Urdu case system under a minimalist framework, in particular, focusing on the differences between Hindi and Urdu which have gone largely undiscussed in the literature. The main intuition is that case features (e.g. nominative, accusative) are not opaque, but rather are formed of bundles of sub-features (e.g. &plusmn;finite, &plusmn;definite) which are checked by functional heads (e.g. T, v). Manipulating the sub-features allows us to capture similarities in the behaviour of nominals with different case forms and differences between the behaviour of nominals with the same case forms. </p>

        <!--
        <p> I work on the Urdu case system under a minimalist framework. The driving intuition behind my <b>PhD project</b> is that case labels, such as 'nominative', 'accusative', and so on, do not refer to completely homogenous groups, even within a single language. This picks up on the observation that each case in Urdu has multiple uses. Two main research questions emerge: (1) What are the differences between multiple uses of a single case? (2) What are the similarities between multiple uses of a single case? The first goal of this project is to provide a cohesive account of case assignment in Urdu. This project takes into consideration a wide range of constructions that are generally studied independently of each other. Taking the interaction between such phenomena into account means that analyses of individual constructions require critical evaluation and potential rework. The second goal of this project is to make contributions to case theory more generally. The detailed analysis of the complex Urdu system will provide insight into case assignment processes (Agree-based vs. dependent case), as well as insights into other current debates in case research, such as the relationship between case and agreement, and the place of case in the grammar. </p>

        <p> My PhD project examines the relationship between Voice, case and external arguments in Urdu. I am probing the properties of active and non-active Voice heads in a range of phenomena. One important finding that I present in my thesis is that so-called accusative-preserving passives have underlyingly active syntax, similar to active impersonal constructions proposed for Polish and Icelandic. Thus, accusative case is reserved to active contexts in Urdu. My thesis (currently in the writing stage) also offers novel perspectives on differential object marking, dative intervention and subject positions.

        <h3> education </h3>
        
        <p> I completed my <b>masters</b> (2018-19), also at the University of Cambridge. My MPhil thesis was supervised by <b>Theresa Biberauer</b> and focused on <b>accusative case in Hindi-Urdu.</b> It was the first attempt at developing a composite case-checking approach for nominative, ergative and accusative cases in Urdu. You can download my MPhil thesis <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a56mux8cpuk65sy/Kidwai_MPhil_2019.pdf?dl=0" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">here</a>. </p>
        
        <p> I was at University College London (UCL) for my <b>undergraduate</b> degree (2015-18). My BA thesis was titled <b><i>Case-(Mis)Matching in Urdu Sluicing</i></b> and was supervised by <b>Klaus Abels</b>. I introduced novel data from Urdu sluicing and showed that there must be syntactic structure in the ellipsis-site and that it stands in a semantic identity relation to its antecedent. The thesis won the <b>Outstanding Undergraduate Dissertation in Linguistics prize</b> from the Linguistics Association of Great Britain (<a href = "http://www.lagb.org.uk/oudil" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">LAGB</a>). The dissertation was later developed into a working paper and published in <i>The Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics</i> (<a href = "https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-occasional-papers-linguistics" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">COPiL</a>). You can find it <a href = "https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/files/copil_12_3_kidwai.pdf" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">here</a>. </p>
        
        <h3> languages </h3>
        
        <p> I am a native speaker of Urdu and (Pakistani) English. I am learning German. </p>
        
        <h3> non-academic interests </h3>
        
        <p> I like cooking, baking and feeding people. I also like psychological thrillers, rom-coms and reality tv. </p>
        
        <p> I was vice-president of the graduate student committee in my college from 2020-21. Before this, I was social secretary in 2019-20. I have a lot of experience in leadership, organising and running events, and working with teams. </p>
