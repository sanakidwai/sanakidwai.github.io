        <p> I'm a <b>final-year linguistics PhD student</b> at the University of Cambridge (Fitzwilliam College). I work on minimalist syntax and morphology. My PhD project is on <b>the interaction between Voice, case and external arguments in Urdu.</b> My supervisors are <b>Theresa Biberauer</b> and <b>Ian Roberts</b>, and my advisor is <b>Adam Ledgeway.</b> </p>
        
        <p> I am funded by the <a href = "https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk/sana-kidwai-2019-cohort" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank"> Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholarship</a>. </p>

        <h3> research interests </h3>
        
        <p> My primary research areas are <b>case systems</b> and <b>Urdu syntax</b>. Other research interests include <b>decomposition of the verbal domain</b>, <b>word order</b>, and <b>South Asian linguistics.</b> Something I am particularly excited about at the moment is <b>micro-variation between Hindi and Urdu</b>, two near-identical languages which are often lumped together in syntactic theory.</p>
        
        <p> My PhD project investigates the relationship between Voice, case and external arguments in Urdu. I am probing the properties of active and non-active Voice heads in a range of phenomena, such as actives, passives and anticausatives. One important finding that I present in my thesis is that so-called accusative-preserving passives have underlyingly active syntax, similar to active impersonal constructions proposed for Polish and Icelandic. This shows that accusative case is reserved to active contexts in Urdu. My thesis (currently in the writing stage) also offers novel perspectives on differential object marking, dative intervention and subjecthood. 
        </p>
        
        <h3> education </h3>
        
        <p> I did my <b>masters</b> at the University of Cambridge (2018-19). My MPhil thesis was supervised by <b>Theresa Biberauer</b> and focused on <b>accusative case in Hindi-Urdu.</b> It also attempted a composite case-checking analysis for nominative, ergative and accusative cases in Urdu. You can download my MPhil thesis <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a56mux8cpuk65sy/Kidwai_MPhil_2019.pdf?dl=0" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">here</a>. </p>
        
        <p> I was at University College London (UCL) for my <b>undergraduate</b> degree (2015-18). My BA thesis was titled <b><i>Case-(Mis)Matching in Urdu Sluicing</i></b> and was supervised by <b>Klaus Abels</b>. I introduced novel data from Urdu sluicing and showed that there must be syntactic structure in the ellipsis-site and that it stands in a semantic identity relation to its antecedent. The thesis won the <b>Outstanding Undergraduate Dissertation in Linguistics prize</b> from the Linguistics Association of Great Britain (<a href = "http://www.lagb.org.uk/oudil" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">LAGB</a>). The dissertation was later developed into a working paper and published in <i>The Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics</i> (<a href = "https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-occasional-papers-linguistics" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">COPiL</a>). You can find it <a href = "https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/files/copil_12_3_kidwai.pdf" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">here</a>. </p>
        
        <h3> languages </h3>
        
        <p> I am a native speaker of Urdu and (Pakistani) English. I am learning German. </p>
        
        <h3> non-academic interests </h3>
        
        <p> I like cooking, baking and feeding people. I also like psychological thrillers, rom-coms and reality tv. </p>
        
        <p> I was vice-president of the graduate student committee in my college from 2020-21. Before this, I was social secretary in 2019-20. I have a lot of experience in leadership, organising and running events, and working with teams. </p>
