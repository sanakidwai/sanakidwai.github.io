        <p> <b> Marked Anticausatives in Urdu. </b><br>
            Talk at <i>Syntax and Semantics Circle</i>, University of California, Berkeley, 9 September 2022.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Anticausatives in Urdu are optionally marked with morphology identical to passives. They can also have an oblique causer, which is identical to the by-phrase found in passives. I apply a series of tests to oblique causers and passives and show that they behave in exactly the same way with the exception that oblique causers in anticausatives are always non-volitional while by-phrases in passives are always volitional. I propose that marked anticausatives and passives both have non-active VoiceP but different types of <i>v</i> (see also Kallulli, 2006, 2007; c.f. Sch&auml;fer, 2009; Alexiadou et al 2015). Oblique causers and by-phrases are both generated in Spec-VoiceP.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h3> current projects </h3>
        
        <p> <b> The role of Voice in case assignment: </b> <br>
            Dating back to Burzio's Generalisation, the strong correlation between accusative case assignment and the presence of the external argument has been integral to any theory of case assignment. The division of labour between Voice and <i>v</i> gives Voice the burden of introducing the EA, and thereby makes it a key piece in accusative case assignment. I adopt the approach that there are different flavours of Voice, which introduce different kinds of EAs in their specifiers. Active Voice obligatorily projects an EA, which is interpreted as a causer or agent. Passive Voice optionally projects an EA, which is interpreted as a causee, or "less agent-like". Complex causatives embed a passive Voice head, resulting in a Voice-over-Voice structure (Nie, 2020). It remains to be seen how the different Voice heads can be captured in featural terms.
        </p>
        
        <p> <b> Subject positions in Urdu: </b> <br>
            Urdu has several types of subjects which take a range of cases (ergative, nominative, dative, instrumental, genitive). Often these subjects pass some but not all of the so-called subject tests, suggesting that subject properties are not associated with a single structural position and that not all subjects are found in the same position. This has previously been suggested for Hindi-Urdu for dative vs ergative and nominative subjects by Davison (2004), and for dative and ergative vs nominative subjects by Poole (2016). I propose that while all subjects occupy SpecVoiceP, only some subjects move higher to SpecTP. Therefore, all subjects show properties associated with SpecVoiceP but only some show properties associated with SpecTP.
        </p>
        <!--
        <p> <b> Instrumental case in Urdu:</b> <br>
            Instrumental case is extremely versatile, and is found on <i>by</i>-phrases, causees, inabilitative subjects, comitatives, instruments and materials, and locations in Urdu. I am interested in the conditions on instrumental case assignment in Urdu. While <i>by</i>-phrases, causees, inabilitative subjects and comitatives, are arguments, instruments, materials and locations are adjuncts. Interestingly, this seems to follow the animacy distinction. One possibility is that there is both an inherent (for adjuncts) and structural (for arguments) instrumental case in Urdu. However, all the arguments are not generated in the same position, making it difficult to identify a functional head responsible for assigning structural instrumental case under an Agree-based approach to case assignment.
        </p>
        -->
        <!--
        <p> <b> Typology of Voice heads in Urdu:</b> <br>
            I am looking at Voice in a range of phenomena in Urdu (actives, passives, impersonals, middles, reflexives, unaccusatives, indirect causatives) and how this affects properties of the external argument, accusative case assignment, interpretation and so on. In doing so, I hope to determine the full typology of Voice heads that are available in Urdu.
