        <p> <b> Intervention in Accusative Case Assignment in Urdu </b><br>
            Talk at <i>Syntax and Morphology Circle</i>, Stanford University, 21 October 2022.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dative indirect objects are known to intervene in accusative case assignment, particularly in languages with differential object marking and dative-accusative syncretism. Urdu is one such language where direct objects are not assigned accusative case in the presence of the dative recipient, even when all conditions for DOM are met. On the other hand, sources marked with instrumental case do not intervene in accusative case assignment. In this talk, I propose an <i>intervention in movement</i> analysis for dative but not instrumental intervention. Direct objects must move to Spec-<i>v</i>P to receive accusative case. Recipients meet the requirements for movement and hence intervene. Sources are PPs and so do not intervene in movement of the object to Spec-<i>v</i>P.

        <p> <b> Deriving Burzio's Generalisation for Urdu: </b> <br>
            Urdu is commonly given as a counterexample to BG because of the acceptability of accusative case in passives. However, simply labelling Urdu as a counterexamples is not explanatory because Urdu does show BG effects most of the time. I investigate the case-assigning properties of different Voice heads in Urdu. I propose that non-active Voice assigns an inherent case to its specifier (the <i>by</i>-phrase) but also has the option of assigning structural accusative case to the object in Urdu. On the assumption that functional heads can only assign one case and that inherent case assignment is preferred over structural case assignment, I propose that accusative case is only available when inherent case to the <i>by</i>-phrase is not. This is based on the key observation that accusative-preserving passives cannot have a <i>by</i>-phrase in Urdu. This also provides strong evidence against dependent case approaches to case assignment which would make the opposite prediction that accusative case should only be possible in the presence of the external argument (<i>by</i>-phrase).

        <p> <b> Urdu light verbs: </b> <br>            
            Butt &amp; Ramchand (2005) propose that different `Light Verbs' (LVs) in Hindi-Urdu sit in different syntactic heads, roughly correlating to Voice and v. These structural positions reflect the semantic effects that LVs have on the event. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/fesobolak/home" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">Fran Sobolak</a> and I are investigating the structural and semantic properties of two Urdu LVs, jaa 'go' and paR 'fall,' first showing that they are in Voice (=Init, Ramchand, 2008), then showing that while they have similar properties to the non-active Voice head in classic passives, they differ enough to warrant a separate Voice head with slightly different functionalities and selection properties. Our project (i) highlights variation in LV structural positions and properties, and (ii) reveals variation in Voice head functionality beyond Kratzer's (1996) original 'Active' and 'Non-active' typology. We will be presenting our work at <a href = "https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/fasal-13/home?authuser=0"class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">(F)ASAL-13</a>.

        <p> <b> Subject positions in Urdu: </b> <br>
            Urdu has several types of subjects which take a range of cases (ergative, nominative, dative, instrumental, genitive). Often these subjects pass some but not all of the so-called subject tests, suggesting that subject properties are not associated with a single structural position and that not all subjects are found in the same position. This has previously been suggested for Hindi-Urdu for dative vs ergative and nominative subjects by Davison (2004), and for dative and ergative vs nominative subjects by Poole (2016). I propose that while all subjects occupy SpecVoiceP, only some subjects move higher to SpecTP. Therefore, all subjects show properties associated with SpecVoiceP but only some show properties associated with SpecTP. I have published a working paper on this in COPiL which you can see <a href = "https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/files/v14_kidwai_submission.pdf" class = highlighted-link target = "_blank">here</a>.

        <p> <b> Instrumental case in Urdu:</b> <br>
            Instrumental case is extremely versatile, and is found on <i>by</i>-phrases, causees, inabilitative subjects, comitatives, instruments and materials, and locations in Urdu. I am interested in the conditions on instrumental case assignment in Urdu. While <i>by</i>-phrases, causees, inabilitative subjects and comitatives, are arguments, instruments, materials and locations are adjuncts. Interestingly, this seems to follow the animacy distinction. One possibility is that there is both an inherent (for adjuncts) and structural (for arguments) instrumental case in Urdu. However, all the arguments are not generated in the same position, making it difficult to identify a functional head responsible for assigning structural instrumental case under an Agree-based approach to case assignment.

        <p> <b> Typology of Voice heads in Urdu:</b> <br>
            I am looking at Voice in a range of phenomena in Urdu (actives, passives, impersonals, middles, reflexives, unaccusatives, indirect causatives) and how this affects properties of the external argument, accusative case assignment, interpretation and so on. In doing so, I hope to determine the full typology of Voice heads that are available in Urdu.
